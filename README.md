# openwrt-ci-packages

OpenWrt packages built, tested in QEMU and turned into firmware images by the
reusable base [wehagy/openwrt-ci](https://github.com/wehagy/openwrt-ci). This
repository holds the packages (`packages/<name>/`: configuration and
package-specific tests); the base holds the workflows, scripts and the generic
package test.

## Layout

- `packages/<name>/config.yml`: data of the package. Today only `package`, the
  name of a directory of `openwrt/packages` (read by the `config` job).
- `packages/<name>/tests/` (optional): pytest files that run next to the
  generic test in the QEMU VM. Missing directory: only the generic test runs.
  The directory does not exist yet for `netbird`: runtime tests are pending.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: calls the base for `netbird` on push to
  `feat/**` and on `workflow_dispatch` (`refresh_sdk`, `lines`).
- `.github/actionlint.yaml`: declares the `ubuntu-26.04` label for actionlint.

## How `ci.yml` uses the base

| Job                          | Calls                         | Notes                                              |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `config`                     | -                             | reads `packages/netbird/config.yml`                |
| `build-25-12`, `build-main`  | `build.yml`                   | `packages: write`: may rebuild the SDK image       |
| `test-25-12`, `test-main`    | `test.yml`, `source: artifact` | `tests_path`, `test_secrets: NB_SETUP_KEY`, `secrets: inherit` |
| `image-25-12`, `image-main`  | `images.yml`                  | profiles of the base                               |

- Each call passes `ci_ref`: the ref of `wehagy/openwrt-ci` the scripts are
  checked out from. It must equal the ref after `@` in `uses:`. No tags are
  used. During the development of the base both are `feat/reusable`; once the
  base is on `main` they become `main`.
- The job logs print `harness: wehagy/openwrt-ci ref <ref> -> <sha>` and
  `caller: wehagy/openwrt-ci-packages run commit <sha>, checkout HEAD <sha>`.

## Secrets

`secrets: inherit` hands the repository secrets to `test.yml`. The names in
`test_secrets` (`NB_SETUP_KEY` for netbird) are exported as environment
variables of `pytest`, and no process above `pytest` keeps the JSON with all
the secrets of this repository in its environment. Values are never printed; a
missing secret is an empty variable, so a test can skip with a reason.

This is hygiene, not isolation: the tests in `tests_path` are code of this
repository, and so is the workflow that passes the secrets; a test could read
anything this repository's own workflow can. Do not put code you do not trust
in `tests_path`.

The log of the `Run tests` step lists the names of all secrets of this
repository (`"NAME": "***"`), never their values.

## SDK image access (once, by the owner)

The base reuses the public SDK image `ghcr.io/wehagy/openwrt-sdk` when it is
fresh (less than a day old). When it must rebuild it, the push uses this
repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which needs: GitHub > Packages > `openwrt-sdk` >
Package settings > Manage Actions access > Add Repository >
`wehagy/openwrt-ci-packages`, role Write (Admin to also delete the superseded
`-prev` version). Without it the job fails with `push of ... denied`.

## Adding a package

1. Create `packages/<name>/config.yml` with `package: <name>` (a directory of
   `openwrt/packages`).
2. Add the jobs of `ci.yml` for it (the `config` job reads one package today).
3. Optional: put pytest files in `packages/<name>/tests/` and pass
   `tests_path: packages/<name>/tests`. They may import `harness_util` and use
   the `vm_ssh` fixture of the base; they must not be named `conftest.py`,
   `harness_util.py` or `test_package.py`.
